# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Payment Infrastructure is a system built on Ripple XRPL designed to eliminate trust deficits in cross-border B2B transactions. The system leverages XRPL's native cross-border payment capabilities while adding AI-powered compliance monitoring, smart contract automation, and stablecoin-backed payment instruments (Smart Cheques) to create a frictionless, secure, and compliant payment ecosystem. This infrastructure addresses the $1-1.5 trillion annual cross-border B2B market by reducing transaction costs by 40-60% while ensuring regulatory compliance and eliminating counterparty risk.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business engaging in cross-border transactions, I want automated KYC and compliance verification, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance without manual overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new business registers THEN the system SHALL initiate AI-powered KYC verification process
2. WHEN KYC verification is complete THEN the system SHALL validate compliance with AML and taxation laws for the business's jurisdiction
3. IF compliance requirements change THEN the system SHALL automatically re-verify and notify affected parties
4. WHEN a transaction is initiated THEN the system SHALL verify both parties maintain valid compliance status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a contract party, I want AI agents to automatically extract and encode contractual obligations, so that payment execution is tied to verifiable deliverables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a digital contract is submitted THEN AI agents SHALL analyze and extract all enforceable obligations
2. WHEN obligations are extracted THEN the system SHALL encode them into XRPL Hooks-based smart contracts
3. WHEN encoding is complete THEN the system SHALL define measurable milestones for each obligation
4. IF contract terms are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL flag for human review before encoding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a payer, I want to purchase and lock funds using Smart Cheques, so that I can guarantee payment while protecting against premature fund release.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN purchasing Smart Cheques THEN the system SHALL accept the platform's Level 1 deflationary currency
2. WHEN Smart Cheques are created THEN funds SHALL be locked in stablecoin-backed instruments
3. WHEN funds are locked THEN the system SHALL prevent withdrawal until contractual obligations are met
4. WHEN Smart Cheques are issued THEN the system SHALL generate immutable payment commitments on XRPL using Escrow transactions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a payee, I want automated milestone tracking and payment execution, so that I receive payments immediately upon fulfilling contractual obligations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI agents are deployed THEN they SHALL integrate with logistics systems (FedEx, DHL APIs)
2. WHEN AI agents are deployed THEN they SHALL integrate with project management tools (Asana, ClickUp)
3. WHEN milestone completion is detected THEN AI agents SHALL verify against contractual requirements
4. WHEN verification is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically release corresponding Smart Cheque payments
5. IF verification requires human validation THEN the system SHALL route to appropriate reviewers before payment release

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a transaction participant, I want real-time transparency and audit trails, so that I can track transaction status and maintain compliance records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any transaction event occurs THEN the system SHALL log immutable records on XRPL ledger
2. WHEN status updates occur THEN all parties SHALL receive real-time notifications
3. WHEN compliance audits are required THEN the system SHALL provide complete transaction histories
4. WHEN disputes arise THEN the system SHALL provide verifiable evidence of milestone completion or failure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business operator, I want the system to handle multi-jurisdictional compliance automatically, so that I can transact globally without regulatory risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transactions cross borders THEN the system SHALL apply relevant tax and regulatory requirements for all jurisdictions
2. WHEN regulatory changes occur THEN the system SHALL update compliance rules automatically
3. WHEN tax obligations are triggered THEN the system SHALL calculate and withhold appropriate amounts
4. WHEN compliance violations are detected THEN the system SHALL halt transactions and notify relevant parties

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want integration with existing business systems, so that I can adopt the payment infrastructure without disrupting current workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with merchant systems THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for common platforms
2. WHEN connecting to tracking systems THEN AI agents SHALL authenticate and monitor without manual intervention
3. WHEN email approvals are required THEN the system SHALL process digitally signed confirmations
4. WHEN human audits are needed THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing issue tracking systems

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a transaction participant, I want automated dispute resolution and fraud prevention, so that I can resolve conflicts fairly without lengthy manual processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI agents analyze transactions THEN they SHALL detect risk patterns and suggest mitigation strategies before contract execution
2. WHEN Smart Cheques are created THEN they SHALL include automated fraud detection rules that flag anomalies
3. WHEN payments are triggered THEN the system SHALL verify deliverables through trusted third-party APIs before execution
4. WHEN disputes arise THEN the system SHALL attempt automated AI-mediated resolution using contract terms and real-world data
5. IF AI cannot resolve disputes THEN the system SHALL escalate to stakeholder-based resolution within 2-5 days
6. IF stakeholder resolution fails THEN the system SHALL connect certified mediators with XRPL transaction data for final arbitration
7. WHEN dispute resolution is complete THEN the system SHALL execute appropriate remediation (refunds, partial payments, or contract modifications)
